# Virtues and Worships of the 12 Months
## Muharram

### Virtue
It is one of the sacred month that Allah mentioned in Qur’an
> Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are Sacred, (i.e. the 1st, the 7th, the 11th and the 12th months of the Islamic calendar). That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein 
> &mdash; <cite>[At-Tawbah 9:36]</cite>

It is also narrated that the Prophet (Peace be upon him) said:
> "The year is twelve months, of which four are sacred: three consecutive months, Dhu al-Qa‘dah, Dhu al-Hijjah and Muharram, and Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumaada and Sha‘baan."
> &mdash; <cite>Bukhari</cite>

There are some additional virtues and mentioning of this month:
- Prophet Nuh’s Ark came to rest on Mount Judi on this day <cite>- Ibn Kathir</cite>
- Fasting on 9th day (Ashoora) used to be obligatory before fasting in the month of the Ramadan became obligatory. <cite>- Bukhari<cite>
  

### Worships
#### Highly Recommended:
- Fast on the day of ‘Ashoora’, the 10th of Maharram.  
  > Fasting the day of Ashoora I hope Allah will expiate thereby for the year that came before it - Muslim.

  Ibn Abbas also said: 
  > I never saw the Prophet (PBHUM) so keen to make sure he fasted any day and preferring it over another except this day, the  day of ‘Ashoora’…” - Bukhari.
 
- Fast on 9th Day (Tasso’a) of Maharram.  Prophet (PBUH) said: 
  > Next year, if Allaah wills, we will fast on the ninth day. - Muslim.

#### Encouraged:
- Fast on 11th of Maharram.  There are difference of opinion regarding this.
- Perform lots of fasting.  "The best fast after Ramadan is in the month of Allah Muharram" - Muslim
- Spend on your family on 10th of this month. <cite>- Al-Bayhaqi, Shu’ab al-Iman and also supported by narration by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal</cite>
